  	<p>
	DDMSence (pronounced "<i>dee-dee-em-Essence</i>") is an open source Java API which supports the 
	<a href="http://metadata.dod.mil/mdr/irs/DDMS/" target="_new">DoD Discovery Metadata Specification (DDMS)</a>. 
	Using XOM and the Xerces Java parser, DDMSence can transform XML DDMS Resource records into a Java object model, 
	allowing them to be manipulated or traversed within the context of a Java environment. 
	DDMSence also performs logical validation of rules which are not coded into the DDMS schema (such as the the validation of longitude/latitude values).
