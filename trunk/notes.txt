Notes for DDMS Team:
	- Schema Issues:
		- The schema comments on producer entities still refers to a "ddms:producer" element which no longer exists.
		- There are many places where an element is required, but is allowed to have an empty value. Is this intended?
		- When count-restricted elements appear in <xs:choice maxOccurs="unbounded">, doesn't that remove the restriction? (geographicIdentifier, geospatialCoverage)
		- Check on facilityIdentifier restriction (restricts geospatialCoverage elements? or geographicIdentifier too?)						
	- Website Issues:
		- HTML example for Person shows "name" instead of "creator.name"
		- XML example for virtualCoverage is malformed and also doesn't have the ddms prefix on its attributes.
		- XML example for dates > infoCutOff (the one with the timezone added) does not validate against the schema
		- XML example for boundingGeometry needs to be updated so that attributes (srsName, etc) are NOT in the gml namespace -- they are local.
		- Documentation lists Format > Media > mimeType as Optional, but schema requires it.		
	- Suggestions for more Examples:		
		- It would be nice to have HTML/Text examples for boundingBox, boundingGeometry, and verticalExtent.
		- If a Person/Organization/etc. has multiple names, phones, emails, how is the Text/HTML output rendered?
