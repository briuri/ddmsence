	<p>
	DDMSence (pronounced "dee-dee-em-Essence") is an open source Java API which supports the <a target="_top" href="http://metadata.dod.mil/mdr/irs/DDMS/">DoD Discovery Metadata Specification</a> (DDMS). 
	Using the XOM and Xerces parsing libraries, DDMSence can convert an XML DDMS Resource record into a Java object model, or ease the conversion of existing Java data into valid, well-formed XML, HTML, and Text records. 
	DDMSence also performs logical validation of rules which are listed in the DDMS documentation but not coded into the DDMS schema.
