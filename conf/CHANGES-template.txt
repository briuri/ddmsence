Release History
===========================================================================

v 1.4.0 (6/08/2010):
This stable release alters configurable properties to be code-driven, instead
of using properties files (Issue #45, 47). It also adds API documentation to
the bin-flavoured download, which should have been there from the beginning.

v 1.3.2 (5/14/2010):
This stable patch release fixes four minor bugs (Issue #40, 41, 42, 44).

v 1.3.1 (5/09/2010):
This stable patch release fixes bug related to namespace resolution when 
working with more than one version of DDMS at a time (Issue #39).

v 1.3.0 (5/07/2010):
This stable release adds support for custom validation rules through ISO 
Schematron.

v 1.2.1 (4/24/2010):
This stable patch release fixes a bug related to QName validation (Issue #37).

v 1.2.0 (4/21/2010):
This stable release improves unit tests and documentation, and adds support for 
configurable properties.

v 1.1.0 (4/08/2010):
This stable release adds support for DDMS 2.0 and the Extensible Layer.
 
v 1.0.0 (4/01/2010):
First official stable release. JARs in "bin" release are compiled under Java 
1.5.

v 0.9.d (3/29/2010):
Includes further improvements to the validation system, controlled vocabulary 
validation for ICISM security attributes, and minor improvements to the 
sample applications.
 
v 0.9.c (3/25/2010):
Adds support for validation warnings in addition to errors. This release
removes the validate() method from the IDDMSComponent interface, because
validating a valid component was overkill. In its place, 
getValidationWarnings() has been added.

Initial beta release. Contains full support for DDMS 3.0 Pre-Release and
the three sample applications.
