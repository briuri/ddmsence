Release History
===========================================================================
v 1.0.0 (4/01/2010):
First official stable release. JARs in "bin" release are compiled under Java 1.5.

v 0.9.d (3/29/2010):
Includes further improvements to the validation system, controlled vocabulary 
validation for ICISM security attributes, and minor improvements to the 
sample applications.
 
v 0.9.c (3/25/2010):
Adds support for validation warnings in addition to errors. This release
removes the validate() method from the IDDMSComponent interface, because
validating a valid component was overkill. In its place, getValidationWarnings()
has been added.

v 0.9.b (3/24/2010):
Initial beta release. Contains full support for DDMS 3.0 Pre-Release and
the three sample applications.
