<h1>Feedback</h1>

<p>I would love to hear about your experiences working with DDMSence, or suggestions for future functionality. Did you find it to be useful? Are there requirements that I
should consider supporting? Is the documentation clear and complete?</p>

<p>You can officially report a bug or enhancement suggestion on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ddmsence/issues/list">Issue Tracking</a> page,
or use the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ddmsence">Discussion</a> area as a less formal method of discussion. Finally, you can
contact me directly by email at
