 * Enumeration of output formats. XML is not an enumeration value, as we rely on XOM for XML output.
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>HTML</b>: HTML meta tags, in accordance with the suggested HTML output from the DDMS Specification.</li>
 * <li><b>JSON</b>: JSON data, which generally follows the naming conventions of the HTML/Text output, rather than
 *    being a straight XML-to-JSON conversion.</li>
 * <li><b>TEXT</b>: Text name-value pairings, in accordance with the suggested Text output from the DDMS Specification.</li>
 * </ul>
