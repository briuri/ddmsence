# DDMSence

DDMSence (pronounced "dee-dee-em-Essence") is the only open-source Java library that fully supports the DoD Discovery Metadata Specification (DDMS). It converts DDMS Resources (also called assertions or metacards) into a Java object model, allowing them to be manipulated or traversed within the context of a Java environment. 

DDMSence is no longer under active development (as the DDMS specification has not been funded in years), although I continue to maintain the library for any legacy users.
